# Project: Hungry Powder

## Overview
**Hungry Powder** uses a fictional material that absorbs atmospheric gases to test scale intuition.

---

## Concept Summary
The concept assumes a material that binds CO₂ and N₂ irreversibly, reducing atmospheric pressure.

---

## Reality Level
**Fantasy**

---

## Primary Question
Can composition change alone solve Venus’s climate problem?

---

## Dominant Failure Mode
**Required mass approaches planetary scale**

---

## Key Takeaways
- Absorbing the atmosphere requires absurd mass
- Energy balance remains unsolved
- Pressure reduction ≠ cooling
