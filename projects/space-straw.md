# Project: Space Straw

## Overview
**Space Straw** explores whether Venus’s atmosphere could be vented directly to space using a hypothetical conduit or “straw.”

This file summarizes the concept and links to the full analysis repository.

---

## Concept Summary
The core idea is that providing a physical path from a high-pressure atmosphere to vacuum would allow atmospheric gas or heat to escape. Variants include passive conduits, pumped systems, and aerostat-supported structures.

---

## Reality Level
**Theoretical**

---

## Primary Question
Can Venus’s atmosphere be passively or actively vented to space at a rate sufficient to reduce pressure or temperature?

---

## Dominant Failure Mode
**Hydrostatic equilibrium and choked flow**

---

## Key Takeaways
- Vacuum access does not imply mass removal
- Atmospheric recompression dominates
- Passive venting intuition fails at scale
