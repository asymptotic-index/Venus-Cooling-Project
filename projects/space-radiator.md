# Project: Space Radiator

## Overview
**Space Radiator** explores direct heat extraction from Venus and rejection to space via large-scale radiative infrastructure.

---

## Concept Summary
The concept models atmospheric heat capture combined with radiators operating above the atmosphere to emit thermal energy directly into space.

---

## Reality Level
**Speculative**

---

## Primary Question
Can continuous heat export overcome Venus’s energy imbalance?

---

## Dominant Failure Mode
**Radiator scale and continuity**

---

## Key Takeaways
- Radiators must operate indefinitely
- Required surface area is extreme
- Infrastructure dominates feasibility
