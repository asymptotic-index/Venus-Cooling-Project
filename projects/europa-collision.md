# Project: Europa Collision

## Overview
**Europa Collision** tests whether adding large amounts of cold mass could absorb Venus’s excess heat.

---

## Concept Summary
This thought experiment assumes Europa’s ice and water are transferred to Venus to act as a thermal sink, absorbing heat and reducing surface temperature.

---

## Reality Level
**Speculative**

---

## Primary Question
Can cold mass meaningfully cool Venus without creating worse secondary effects?

---

## Dominant Failure Mode
**Pressure increase and runaway greenhouse**

---

## Key Takeaways
- Cooling is temporary
- Pressure increases catastrophically
- Water becomes supercritical
- Net warming dominates
