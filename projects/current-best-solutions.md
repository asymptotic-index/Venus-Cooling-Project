# Project: Current Best Solutions

## Overview
**Current Best Solutions** synthesizes approaches aligned with existing literature and research.

---

## Concept Summary
Rather than a single solution, this repository examines combinations of solar shading, radiative cooling, atmospheric modification, and long timescales.

---

## Reality Level
**Grounded**

---

## Primary Question
What approaches survive contact with real physics and research?

---

## Dominant Failure Mode
**Timescale and integration complexity**

---

## Key Takeaways
- No single silver bullet exists
- Systems approaches dominate
- Venus cooling is multi-century at best
