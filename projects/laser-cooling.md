# Project: Laser Cooling

## Overview
**Laser Cooling** evaluates whether directed energy systems could increase Venus’s net heat loss through stimulated emission or targeted radiative processes.

---

## Concept Summary
The concept investigates whether lasers tuned to specific atmospheric transitions could force energy to be radiated away faster than it is absorbed, acting as a planetary-scale cooling mechanism.

---

## Reality Level
**Theoretical**

---

## Primary Question
Can laser-driven emission increase net outgoing radiation from an optically thick atmosphere?

---

## Dominant Failure Mode
**Reabsorption and energy balance**

---

## Key Takeaways
- Emitted photons are reabsorbed in dense CO₂
- Net cooling behaves like a heat pump
- Power requirements exceed gains
