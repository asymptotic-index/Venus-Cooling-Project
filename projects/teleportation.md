# Project: Teleportation

## Overview
**Teleportation** uses an explicitly fantastical assumption to isolate energy and mass constraints.

---

## Concept Summary
The atmosphere of Venus is assumed to be teleportable at a fixed energy cost per volume and redistributed to other bodies to reduce pressure.

---

## Reality Level
**Fantasy**

---

## Primary Question
Is Venus cooling limited by energy alone, or by deeper physical laws?

---

## Dominant Failure Mode
**Assumption violates physics, but scale still dominates**

---

## Key Takeaways
- Even impossible tools face energy limits
- Jupiter-scale effects are negligible
- Mass dominates intuition
