# Project: Cosmic Blast

## Overview
**Cosmic Blast** evaluates whether extreme impulsive energy inputs could cool Venus by ejecting atmosphere or heat.

---

## Concept Summary
This project abstracts massive explosions or energy impacts and examines their effect on atmospheric retention and thermal balance.

---

## Reality Level
**Theoretical**

---

## Primary Question
Can impulsive energy inputs remove heat faster than they add it?

---

## Dominant Failure Mode
**Thermalization and rebound effects**

---

## Key Takeaways
- Energy mostly becomes heat
- Atmosphere reforms
- Damage replaces cooling
