# CHANGELOG.md  
## Venus Cooling Project — Master Repository

All notable changes to the **Venus Cooling Project** will be documented in this file.

This changelog tracks:
- additions or removal of concept repositories,
- structural or methodological changes to the master project,
- and major public-facing milestones (e.g., video releases).

Individual repositories maintain their **own changelogs** for detailed analytical revisions.

---

## Versioning Scheme

This project follows a simplified semantic versioning model:

- **MAJOR** — Project-wide scope, philosophy, or structural changes  
- **MINOR** — New concept repositories or significant expansions  
- **PATCH** — Clarifications, documentation improvements, or formatting changes  

Version numbers apply to the **project as a whole**, not to individual repos.

## Summary

- and refining understanding of scale.

That evolution is intentional and ongoing.
