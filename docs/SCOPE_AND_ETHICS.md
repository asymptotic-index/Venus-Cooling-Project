## Venus Cooling Project — Scope, Intent, and Ethical Framing

This document defines the **project-wide scope and ethical context** for the **Venus Cooling Project**.

It applies to the master repository and all linked concept repositories unless a specific repo states otherwise.

---

## Project Scope

The Venus Cooling Project explores **extreme, theoretical, speculative, and occasionally fantastical ideas** related to cooling Venus’s atmosphere and surface environment.

These ideas are evaluated to:
- Test intuition against **scale**
- Expose **energy, mass, and time constraints**
- Distinguish between ideas that are:
  - physically grounded,
  - theoretically possible but impractical,
  - or intentionally impossible

The project does **not** aim to design, advocate for, or propose real-world implementation.

---

## What This Project Is

- An **educational exploration** of planetary-scale engineering problems
- A collection of **comparative case studies**
- A tool for building intuition about:
  - thermodynamics,
  - atmospheric physics,
  - radiative balance,
  - and systems failure

Negative results are treated as **valid and valuable outcomes**.

---

## What This Project Is Not

This project is **not**:
- A terraforming proposal
- A policy recommendation
- An engineering roadmap
- A claim of feasibility
- A claim of ownership over scientific principles

All foundational physics and mathematics belong to the global scientific community and are used in good faith.

---

## Treatment of Speculation and Fantasy

Some repositories intentionally include:
- speculative assumptions,
- hypothetical technologies,
- or explicitly fantastical elements.

These are used **only** to:
- isolate constraints,
- stress-test intuition,
- and demonstrate that even impossible tools often fail when confronted with scale.

Such elements are:
- clearly labeled,
- quantified where possible,
- and never presented as achievable with foreseeable technology.

---

## Ethical Considerations

### 1. Avoiding Misuse
Concepts are framed to discourage:
- technological sensationalism,
- misleading optimism,
- or claims of imminent feasibility.

### 2. Transparency
All assumptions, simplifications, and omissions are stated explicitly within each repository.

### 3. Attribution and Openness
The project is released under **CC BY-SA 4.0** to encourage reuse, critique, and extension, provided attribution is maintained and derivative works remain open.

### 4. No Advocacy
The project does not advocate altering planetary environments, nor does it weigh the moral implications of doing so beyond educational context.

---

## Relationship to Individual Repositories

Each concept repository:
- Defines its own assumptions
- Contains its own detailed analysis
- May narrow or expand scope as appropriate to the idea

This master document exists to ensure **consistent framing**, not to constrain exploration.

---

## Summary

The Venus Cooling Project exists to answer one recurring question:

> *“What actually breaks when we scale this idea to a planet?”*

Understanding failure at scale is a prerequisite to understanding success.

That understanding is the purpose of this project.
