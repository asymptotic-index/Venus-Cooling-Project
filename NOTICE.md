# NOTICE

This repository is part of a broader creative and educational project exploring
extreme, theoretical, speculative, and occasionally fantastical ideas related to
planetary science, physics, and engineering.

Concepts presented here span a range that includes:
- physically grounded analysis,
- theoretical extrapolation,
- and intentionally speculative or fantasy ideas.

They are included for the purpose of exploration, comparison, scale analysis,
and education — not as proposals for construction, implementation, or policy.

All calculations and models are intended to illustrate constraints, tradeoffs,
and orders of magnitude. No claim is made regarding feasibility, originality of
scientific principles, or priority over existing research.

Foundational physics, equations, and scientific knowledge belong to the global
scientific community and are used here in good faith.

Authorship applies to the structure, framing, organization, and presentation of
this project as an idea archive.

If you reference or build upon this material, attribution to the project or
repository is appreciated.

This work is shared openly to encourage curiosity, critical thinking, and a
better intuition for large-scale problems.
