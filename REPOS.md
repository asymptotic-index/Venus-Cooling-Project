## Venus Cooling Project — Repository Index

This document is the canonical index of all repositories in the **Venus Cooling Project**.  
Each sub-repo is self-contained and linked here for navigation, comparison, and version tracking.

**Reality Level legend**
- **Grounded** — Consistent with known physics; infeasible only by scale/resources
- **Theoretical** — Speculative extensions of known physics
- **Speculative** — Requires major breakthroughs or extreme assumptions
- **Fantasy** — Intentionally impossible; used to test intuition and scale

## Repository Catalog

| ID | Repository | Reality Level | Status | Core Question | Primary Failure Mode | Repo Link |
|----|------------|---------------|--------|---------------|----------------------|----------|
| 00 | **Venus Cooling Project** | Grounded | Active | Can Venus be cooled at all, in principle? | Scale dominates all solutions | (this repo) |
| 01 | **Space Straw** | Theoretical | Complete | Can atmosphere be passively vented to space? | Hydrostatic equilibrium & choked flow | LINK_TBD |
| 02 | **Laser Cooling** | Theoretical | Complete | Can lasers increase net radiative heat loss? | Reabsorption & energy balance | LINK_TBD |
| 03 | **Europa Collision** | Speculative | Complete | Can cold mass absorb Venus’s heat? | Pressure & runaway greenhouse | LINK_TBD |
| 04 | **Teleportation** | Fantasy | Complete | Is Venus cooling energy- or law-limited? | Assumption violates physics | LINK_TBD |
| 05 | **Cosmic Blast** | Theoretical | Complete | Can extreme energy impulses remove heat? | Thermalization & rebound effects | LINK_TBD |
| 06 | **Space Radiator** | Speculative | Complete | Can heat be actively exported to space? | Radiator scale & continuity | LINK_TBD |
| 07 | **Hungry Powder** | Fantasy | Complete | Can atmosphere be chemically removed? | Required mass ~10²⁰ kg | LINK_TBD |
| 08 | **Current Best Solutions** | Grounded | Active | What approaches survive literature review? | Timescales & integration | LINK_TBD |

## Status Definitions

- **Draft** — Core idea outlined; math incomplete
- **Active** — Under revision or expansion
- **Complete** — Internally consistent; conclusions stable
- **Archived** — Retained for reference only

## Cross-Project Consistency

All repos aim to:
- Use the same **Venus baseline constants** (see `docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md`)
- Show **order-of-magnitude math**
- Explicitly state **what is ignored**
- Separate *intuition* from *calculation*

Comparisons between repos should reference this index to avoid misaligned assumptions.
