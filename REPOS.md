## Venus Cooling Project — Repository Index

This document is the canonical index of all repositories in the **Venus Cooling Project**.  
Each sub-repo is self-contained and linked here for navigation, comparison, and version tracking.

**Reality Level legend**
- **Grounded** — Consistent with known physics; infeasible only by scale/resources
- **Theoretical** — Speculative extensions of known physics
- **Speculative** — Requires major breakthroughs or extreme assumptions
- **Fantasy** — Intentionally impossible; used to test intuition and scale

Fantasy entries may intentionally violate conclusions reached in other repositories in order to test whether system-level closure emerges once a single impossible constraint is removed.

## Status Definitions

- **Draft** — Core idea outlined; math incomplete
- **Active** — Under revision or expansion
- **Complete** — Internally consistent; conclusions stable
- **Archived** — Retained for reference only

---

## Cross-Project Consistency

All repos aim to:
- Use the same **Venus baseline constants** (see `docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md`)
- Show **order-of-magnitude math**
- Explicitly state **what is ignored**
- Separate *intuition* from *calculation*

Comparisons between repos should reference this index to avoid misaligned assumptions.
